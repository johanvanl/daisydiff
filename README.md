daisydiff
=========

A fork of [daisydiff](https://code.google.com/p/daisydiff/), the open source HTML diffing library.

Removed the top panel on the output html created by daisy diff, as well as made it a lot more user friendly, by diffing two html files or two strings. This fork outputs to a string, which can then be written to an html file if needed.
